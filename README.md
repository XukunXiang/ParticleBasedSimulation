# Particle-Based Simulation
This repository is based on codes for Particle-Based Simulation course for Spring 2018.
## MD
Done:
- LJ potential
- periodic boundary condition with minimum image convention
- Poor Man's neighbor list

Working on:
1. MPI
	- [] psudo code ready for 2D MPI implementation
		- [] particle decomposition
		- [] spatial decomposition
	- [] get familiar with MPI and Isend and Irecv
	- [] 2D MPI implementation

Next:
1. Linked-Cell List
1. GPU
