# Particle-Based Simulation
This repository is based on codes for Particle-Based Simulation course for Spring 2018.
## MD
Done:
- LJ potential
- periodic boundary condition with minimum image convention
- Poor Man's neighbor list

Working on: MPI
- [x] psudo code ready for 2D MPI implementation
	- [x] particle decomposition
	- [x] spatial decomposition
- [x] get familiar with MPI and Isend and Irecv
- [ ] 2D MPI implementation

Next:
1. Linked-Cell List
1. GPU
